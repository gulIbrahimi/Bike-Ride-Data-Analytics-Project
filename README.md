# 🚴‍♀️ Bike Ride Data Analytics Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores bike-sharing data to uncover usage patterns, seasonal trends, and rider behavior across time. By leveraging real-world datasets, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series modeling, and interactive data visualizations to understand how people use shared bikes in urban environments.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – for data preprocessing and analysis  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – for data wrangling  
- **Plotly / Streamlit** – for interactive web-based visualizations  
- **Tableau** – for dashboard development (optional)  
- **Kaggle** – data source  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration
