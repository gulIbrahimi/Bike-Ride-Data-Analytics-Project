# 🚴‍♀️ Bike Ride Data Analytics Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover usage trends, seasonal patterns, and user behavior across time. Using real-world datasets, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and time-series-based metrics such as moving averages to understand how people use shared bikes in urban environments.
